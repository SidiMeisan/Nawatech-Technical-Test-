# Nawatech: Technical Test Developer

This Laravel project was developed as part of the Nawatech Technical Test for the Developer position. The test primarily focused on reading JSON files, combining data from two JSON sources, and sorting it in ascending order.

## Project Overview

In this project, the following key tasks were successfully accomplished:

- **Reading JSON Files**: The functionality to read JSON files within the Laravel environment was implemented. Two JSON files, `JSON 1.json` and `JSON 2.json`, were provided for this purpose.

- **Combining Data**: Data from these two JSON files was combined, involving merging relevant information from both sources to create a single, comprehensive dataset.

- **Sorting Data**: Sorting logic was implemented to arrange the combined data in ascending order based on specific criteria.

## Getting Started

To evaluate the solution and explore the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local environment.

2. If you haven't already, install Laravel and its dependencies using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

    composer install
    ```

3. Start the Laravel development server:

    php artisan serve
    ```

    This will launch the server and provide a URL for accessing the project.

4. Access the API through the following URL:

    ```shell
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/
